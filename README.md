# Hotel-data-analysis
Analysis of Hotel Data to get insights and predicting possible aspects of hotel management to ease the functioning of decisions making  

1. Checking data types of all columns 
2. Understanding Numerical and Categorical variables
	a. Check for Missing values 
	b. under standing the meaning of NULL and Zeros 
	c. Outliers cause detection and imputation 
3. Date, month and year is extracted from reservation_status_date for analysing 
3. Plotting different plots for uni-variate ,bi-variate and multivariate to understand the trend and gain insights
4. Creating model for prediction to predict whether a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests


To predict whether a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests various model were build are

		1.Logistic Regression model 
		2. Random Forest model
 
Then Feature Importance was calculated 
Finally grid search cv was applied on the model which gives best performance in this case Random forest perform well
